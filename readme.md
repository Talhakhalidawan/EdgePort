# 🖱️ EdgePort

**Teleport your cursor. Supercharge your workflow.**

EdgePort is a lightweight Windows utility that gives your mouse the power of *teleportation*. Designed for multi-monitor setups, ultra-wide screens, or anyone who wants to stop wasting time dragging their cursor across the screen.

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

With a single hotkey press, **EdgePort** instantly moves your cursor from one edge of the screen to the opposite — left to right, top to bottom, or between monitors.  
It’s like *alt-tab* for your mouse.

Perfect for:
